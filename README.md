Annotating and inferring compositional structures in numeral systems across languages

## Abstract

> In this article, we explore the compositional structure of numeral systems in various languages and language families across the world. A standard method in linguistics for understanding word composition is to break down these words into their parts (morphemes) and translate them separately (as ‘glosses’). We present new techniques using such morpheme glosses, as proposed by Hill and List (2017), to annotate the compositionality of number words. We discuss ways for automating this annotation process and examine the role of individual word components that share a common etymological history (partial cognacy) for the detection and annotation of numerals. In doing so, we provide a computational framework for revealing the intricate structures within numeral systems across languages, examining the importance of compositionality for building larger numeral expressions.
