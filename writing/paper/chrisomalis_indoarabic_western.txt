Hi folks,

Good seeing those of you who were on this morning's call.  As requested, I have attached three pages from the introduction of my book, /Reckonings: Numerals, Cognition, and History /(MIT, 2020), pp. xv - xvii on the question of what to call the digits 0123456789, which I argue "Western numerals" better reflects the history of the enormous phylogeny of Indo-Arabic systems (the positional, decimal systems that use nine symbols plus a zero) descended from a South Asian ancestor (and ultimately further back still).   I'll be talking about this (a bit) in my contribution to this special issue but it's one I've covered many times elsewhere, and this attached passage is probably the most succinct and clear account of my thinking.

The only thing I'd add is that I recognize that some people don't like to use the term "Western" at all - and I understand why, both because of the "West of what?" issue and because it carries a lot of political baggage.  In part I use it because I want that political baggage at the forefront - I want people not to think of 0123456789 as a set of digits that 'won' simply because they are the best, but rather because of Western imperialism and colonialism that caused many, many other systems, including lots of structurally identical systems, to be replaced.   The question of why we are not all using Bengali or Tibetan or Thai numerals has nothing to do with their structure and everything to do with global history over the past five centuries. This is why I reject terms like "common numerals" that obscure, rather than bring out, the history that led to the current world distribution of numerical notations.

So I'm happiest if people want to talk about the Indo-Arabic /family // /phylogeny /of systems that are decimal and positional with a zero, which then necessitates a term, for which I suggest "Western", for the specific variant of that family that is currently (but not eternally) dominant.

Cheers,

Steve
